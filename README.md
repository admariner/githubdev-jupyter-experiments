# GitHub Dev Python & Jupyter Experiments

The idea of this experimental mini-project is to test possibilities of creating and running a basic Python-based analytics / Data Science stack directly in the browser, using so minimal setup.

What I want to test is if it is possible to do:

* A project in a completely free environment (yes I know, projects like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) are also free).
* Running it completely directly in a browser, without use of cloud-based spinned machines (so yes, in contrast to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)).
* Test how much can be done of some basic tasks (getting data, basic data crunching and cleaning using Numpy and Pandas, some visualisations using Matplotlib).
* See if all of that can be done using a reasonably modern tablet or even a phone.
